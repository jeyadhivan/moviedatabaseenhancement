   - API integration using mock APIs

   - Component lifecycle management

   - Conditional rendering

   - Client-side routing with React Router
  
   - Reusable components & clean code structure

   - Responsive design with Flexbox

## 🛠️ Features

✅ Fetches movie data using mock APIs

✅ Component lifecycle methods used to fetch data when components mount
